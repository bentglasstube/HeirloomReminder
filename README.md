Heirloom Reminder
=================

A simple add-on to remind you when you don't have your heirlooms
equipped.

Reminders happen every time your character zones.  Currently, it will
remind you to equip chest and shoulder heirlooms until level 80 and
helm, cloak, and legs until level 85.

Known Bugs
----------

Sometimes, not all equipment is loaded when you first log in, so it
might give spurious warnings on first log in.

Upcoming Features 
-----------------

 * Add options to remind about other heirloom slots.
 * Add per-character ignore settings.
 * Add options to decide how to display reminders.
